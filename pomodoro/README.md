# The Pomodoro Clock 🍅

The Pomodoro Technique is very used to help focus in your activities. It consists of a 25 minutes length study section, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes.
This app eases it a little bit, becase the user can choose the length of the study section and break, making it more personal.

Fun fact: This app was developed using the Pomodoro technique. 😅
